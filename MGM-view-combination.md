### Image Distribution for Mammogram Cases
Figures below shows the image distribution across cases for all bag sizes in MGM-VV dataset. We can see that the largest number of cases occur for bag size 4 for image combination LCC+LMLO+RCC+RMLO, i.e., the usually occurring 4 standard view images from both breast sides. The next most common occurring combination is LCC+LMLO+LXCCL+RCC+RMLO+RXCCL, bag size 6. There's quite a lot of most infrequent combination containing 1 case (see cases with count 1).
